/**
 * Annotates a task chain for the TEA (Tasking Engine Advanced).
 * <p>
 * This annotation has the effect that no {@link TaskingLifeCycleListener} will
 * be called whenever the annotated {@link TaskChain} (or any of it's tasks) is
 * executed.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this annotation lies in wrapping and nesting
 * {@link TaskChain}s around third party technologies. In this case it can
 * happen that there is a task chain that holds a single proxy task that
 * executes the actual {@link TaskChain} (which will/should have the full
 * lifecycle).
 * <p>
 * Another use case is to re-use the TEA infrastructure to execute setup tasks
 * that should run in the background without user visibility.
